#Nebula Terminal Theme
Nebula is a terminal theme based off of the monokai theme.

I have modified the colors and font a bit. 

I use this theme daily so I thought I would share.

#How to install
1. Clone the repository `git clone git:github.com/tylerpope/Nebula-Terminal.git`
2. Open Nebula.terminal

You can modify the settings in the terminal prefrences to your liking.
